Rust API
========

This page contains the API reference for the Rust API. The tvm-ffi project provides
Rust bindings that allow you to use the TVM FFI from Rust programs.

Crates
------

The Rust API is organized into three crates:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Crate
     - Description
   * - ðŸ“¦ `tvm-ffi <generated/tvm_ffi/index.html>`_
     - High-level Rust bindings with safe abstractions for FFI objects, functions, tensors, and containers.
   * - ðŸ“¦ `tvm-ffi-sys <generated/tvm_ffi_sys/index.html>`_
     - Low-level unsafe bindings to the C API.
   * - ðŸ“¦ `tvm-ffi-macros <generated/tvm_ffi_macros/index.html>`_
     - Procedural macros for deriving Object and ObjectRef traits.
