Reproduce CI/CD
===============

This guide explains how to reproduce CI checks and tests locally,
and how wheel builds and releases work.
All CI/CD workflows are defined under `.github/workflows/ <https://github.com/apache/tvm-ffi/tree/main/.github/workflows>`__.
For building the project from source, see :doc:`source_build`.

Linters
-------

Pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~

The project uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ to run linters and
formatters. All hooks are defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml <https://github.com/apache/tvm-ffi/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml>`__. Install and
register the git hooks so they run automatically before each commit:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv tool install pre-commit
   pre-commit install

You can also run hooks manually:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all hooks on every file
   pre-commit run --all-files

   # Run only on staged files
   pre-commit run

   # Run a single hook in isolation
   pre-commit run ruff-check --all-files
   pre-commit run clang-format --all-files

The main linters per language are:

- **Python** -- ``ruff`` (lint + format), ``ty`` (type checking)
- **C/C++** -- ``clang-format`` (format), ``clang-tidy`` (lint, see below)
- **Cython** -- ``cython-lint``
- **CMake** -- ``cmake-format``, ``cmake-lint``
- **Shell** -- ``shfmt``, ``shellcheck``

If you run into issues with pre-commit:

- **Version problems** -- ensure you have pre-commit 2.18.0 or later
  (``pre-commit --version``).
- **Stale cache** -- run ``pre-commit clean`` to clear the hook cache.
- **Auto-fixed files** -- most formatting hooks fix issues in place. Review the
  changes, stage them with ``git add -u``, and commit again.

clang-tidy
~~~~~~~~~~

``clang-tidy`` is run as a separate CI job (not as a pre-commit hook) and only
checks C++ files that have changed. To reproduce it locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run clang-tidy on specific files
   uv run --no-project --with "clang-tidy==21.1.1" \
     python tests/lint/clang_tidy_precommit.py \
       --build-dir=build-pre-commit \
       --jobs=$(nproc) \
       include/tvm/ffi/c_api.h src/some_file.cc

   # Or run on all C++ sources
   uv run --no-project --with "clang-tidy==21.1.1" \
     python tests/lint/clang_tidy_precommit.py \
       --build-dir=build-pre-commit \
       --jobs=$(nproc) \
       ./src/ ./include ./tests

.. note::

   On macOS, ``clang-tidy`` is resolved through ``xcrun``. The wrapper
   ``tests/lint/clang_tidy_precommit.py`` handles this automatically.


C++ Tests
---------

Build and run locally. First, set ``CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`` to speed up
the build:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=$(nproc)   # Linux
   export CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)  # macOS

Then configure, build, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Configure with tests enabled
   cmake . -B build_test -DTVM_FFI_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

   # Build the test target
   cmake --build build_test --clean-first --config Debug --target tvm_ffi_tests

   # Run tests
   ctest -V -C Debug --test-dir build_test --output-on-failure

.. note::

   On Windows, make sure you run the build from a
   **Developer Command Prompt for VS** or have the MSVC toolchain on your
   ``PATH``.


Python Tests
------------

Reproduce locally with:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install the project in editable mode with test dependencies
   uv pip install --reinstall --verbose -e ".[test]"

   # Run the full test suite
   uv run pytest -vvs tests/python


Rust Tests
----------

Rust tests live in the ``rust/`` workspace. Run them with:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd rust && cargo test

This tests all workspace members (``tvm-ffi``, ``tvm-ffi-sys``,
``tvm-ffi-macros``).

.. note::

   CI runs Rust tests only after the Python package is installed (
   ``uv pip install -e ".[test]"``), because the Rust FFI bindings link
   against the built shared library. Make sure the Python package is
   installed before running ``cargo test``.


Build Python Wheels
-------------------

CI builds wheels using `cibuildwheel <https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/>`__
on Linux (x86_64, aarch64), Windows (AMD64), and macOS (arm64).
The wheel configuration lives in the ``[tool.cibuildwheel]`` section of
``pyproject.toml``.

To build a wheel locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv tool install cibuildwheel
   cibuildwheel --output-dir dist

You can restrict the build to a single platform:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build only for the current platform
   cibuildwheel --only cp312-macosx_arm64

Use environment variables to control the target platform:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Choose manylinux image (e.g. manylinux2014, manylinux_2_28)
   CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE=manylinux_2_28 cibuildwheel --output-dir dist

   # Set macOS deployment target
   CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_MACOS="MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14" cibuildwheel --output-dir dist

   # Build only specific Python versions
   CIBW_BUILD="cp312-*" cibuildwheel --output-dir dist
