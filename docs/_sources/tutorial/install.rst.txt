Depending on your needs and your working environment, there are a few different
methods for installing TVM. These include:

* Installing from source
* Installing from third-party binary package.

Installing From Source
----------------------
Installing from source is the recommended method for installing TVM. It will
allow you to enable specific features such as GPU support, microcontroller
support (microTVM), and a debugging runtime, and other features. You will also
want to install from source if you want to actively contribute to the TVM
project. The full instructions are on the :ref:`Install TVM From Source
<install-from-source>` page.

Installing From Binary Packages
--------------------------------
You may install convenient third party binary package distributions to
quickly try things out. TLCPack is a third party volunteer community that
builds binary packages from TVM source. It offers a support matrix with
instructions to install on different platforms, with different features.
Check out  `TLCPack <https://tlcpack.ai>`_ to learn more. Note that the
third party binary packages could contain additional licensing terms for
the hardware drivers that are bundled with it.
