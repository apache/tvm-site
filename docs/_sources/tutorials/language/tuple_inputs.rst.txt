Compute and Reduce with Tuple Inputs
=======================================
**Author**: `Ziheng Jiang <https://github.com/ZihengJiang>`_

Often we want to compute multiple outputs with the same shape within
a single loop or perform reduction that involves multiple values like
:code:`argmax`. These problems can be addressed by tuple inputs.

In this tutorial, we will introduce the usage of tuple inputs in TVM.


.. code-block:: default

    from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function

    import tvm
    from tvm import te
    import numpy as np


Describe Batchwise Computation
------------------------------
For operators which have the same shape, we can put them together as
the inputs of :any:`te.compute`, if we want them to be scheduled
together in the next schedule procedure.



.. code-block:: default

    n = te.var("n")
    m = te.var("m")
    A0 = te.placeholder((m, n), name="A0")
    A1 = te.placeholder((m, n), name="A1")
    B0, B1 = te.compute((m, n), lambda i, j: (A0[i, j] + 2, A1[i, j] * 3), name="B")

    # The generated IR code would be:
    s = te.create_schedule(B0.op)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A0, A1, B0, B1], simple_mode=True))

Describe Reduction with Collaborative Inputs
--------------------------------------------
Sometimes, we require multiple inputs to express some reduction
operators, and the inputs will collaborate together, e.g. :code:`argmax`.
In the reduction procedure, :code:`argmax` need to compare the value of
operands, also need to keep the index of operand. It can be expressed
with :py:func:`te.comm_reducer` as below:


.. code-block:: default


    # x and y are the operands of reduction, both of them is a tuple of index
    # and value.
    def fcombine(x, y):
        lhs = tvm.tir.Select((x[1] >= y[1]), x[0], y[0])
        rhs = tvm.tir.Select((x[1] >= y[1]), x[1], y[1])
        return lhs, rhs


    # our identity element also need to be a tuple, so `fidentity` accepts
    # two types as inputs.
    def fidentity(t0, t1):
        return tvm.tir.const(-1, t0), tvm.te.min_value(t1)


    argmax = te.comm_reducer(fcombine, fidentity, name="argmax")

    # describe the reduction computation
    m = te.var("m")
    n = te.var("n")
    idx = te.placeholder((m, n), name="idx", dtype="int32")
    val = te.placeholder((m, n), name="val", dtype="int32")
    k = te.reduce_axis((0, n), "k")
    T0, T1 = te.compute((m,), lambda i: argmax((idx[i, k], val[i, k]), axis=k), name="T")

    # the generated IR code would be:
    s = te.create_schedule(T0.op)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [idx, val, T0, T1], simple_mode=True))


.. note::

  For ones who are not familiar with reduction, please refer to
  :ref:`general-reduction`.

Schedule Operation with Tuple Inputs
------------------------------------
It is worth mentioning that although you will get multiple outputs
with one batch operation, but they can only be scheduled together
in terms of operation.


.. code-block:: default


    n = te.var("n")
    m = te.var("m")
    A0 = te.placeholder((m, n), name="A0")
    B0, B1 = te.compute((m, n), lambda i, j: (A0[i, j] + 2, A0[i, j] * 3), name="B")
    A1 = te.placeholder((m, n), name="A1")
    C = te.compute((m, n), lambda i, j: A1[i, j] + B0[i, j], name="C")

    s = te.create_schedule(C.op)
    s[B0].compute_at(s[C], C.op.axis[0])
    # as you can see in the below generated IR code:
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A0, A1, C], simple_mode=True))


Summary
-------
This tutorial introduces the usage of tuple inputs operation.

- Describe normal batchwise computation.
- Describe reduction operation with tuple inputs.
- Notice that you can only schedule computation in terms of operation instead of tensor.
