It will\nallow you to enable specific features such as GPU support, microcontroller\nsupport (microTVM), and a debugging runtime, and other features. You will also\nwant to install from source if you want to actively contribute to the TVM\nproject. The full instructions are on the `Install TVM From Source\n<install-from-source>` page.\n\n"

        "Installing From Binary Packages\n--------------------------------\nYou may install convenient third-party binary package distributions to\nquickly try things out. TLCPack is a thirdparty volunteer community that\nbuilds binary packages from TVM source. It offers support matrix with\ninstructions to install on different platforms, with different features.\nCheckout  `TLCPack <https://tlcpack.ai>`_ to learn more. Note that the\nthirdparty binary packages could contain additional licensing terms for\nthe hardware drivers that are bundled with it.\n\n"
