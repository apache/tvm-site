Compiling and Optimizing a Model with the Python Interface (AutoTVM)
====================================================================
**Author**:
`Chris Hoge <https://github.com/hogepodge>`_

In the `TVMC Tutorial <tvmc_command_line_driver>`_, we covered how to compile, run, and tune a
pre-trained vision model, ResNet-50-v2 using the command line interface for
TVM, TVMC. TVM is more that just a command-line tool though, it is an
optimizing framework with APIs available for a number of different languages
that gives you tremendous flexibility in working with machine learning models.

In this tutorial we will cover the same ground we did with TVMC, but show how
it is done with the Python API. Upon completion of this section, we will have
used the Python API for TVM to accomplish the following tasks:

* Compile a pre-trained ResNet 50 v2 model for the TVM runtime.
* Run a real image through the compiled model, and interpret the output and model
  performance.
* Tune the model that model on a CPU using TVM.
* Re-compile an optimized model using the tuning data collected by TVM.
* Run the image through the optimized model, and compare the output and model
  performance.

The goal of this section is to give you an overview of TVM's capabilites and
how to use them through the Python API.

TVM is a deep learning compiler framework, with a number of different modules
available for working with deep learning models and operators. In this
tutorial we will work through how to load, compile, and optimize a model
using the Python API.

We begin by importing a number of dependencies, including ``onnx`` for
loading and converting the model, helper utilities for downloading test data,
the Python Image Library for working with the image data, ``numpy`` for pre
and post-processing of the image data, the TVM Relay framework, and the TVM
Graph Executor.


.. code-block:: default


    import onnx
    from tvm.contrib.download import download_testdata
    from PIL import Image
    import numpy as np
    import tvm.relay as relay
    import tvm
    from tvm.contrib import graph_executor







Downloading and Loading the ONNX Model
--------------------------------------

For this tutorial, we will be working with ResNet-50 v2. ResNet-50 is a
convolutional neural network that is 50-layers deep and designed to classify
images. The model we will be using has been pre-trained on more than a
million images with 1000 different classifications. The network has an input
image size of 224x224. If you are interested exploring more of how the
ResNet-50 model is structured, we recommend downloading
`Netron <https://netron.app>`_, a freely available ML model viewer.

TVM provides a helper library to download pre-trained models. By providing a
model URL, file name, and model type through the module, TVM will download
the model and save it to disk. For the instance of an ONNX model, you can
then load it into memory using the ONNX runtime.

.. note:: Working with Other Model Formats

  TVM supports many popular model formats. A list can be found in the
  :ref:`Compile Deep Learning Models <tutorial-frontend>` section of the TVM
  Documentation.


.. code-block:: default


    model_url = "".join(
        [
            "https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/",
            "master/vision/classification/resnet/model/",
            "resnet50-v2-7.onnx",
        ]
    )

    model_path = download_testdata(model_url, "resnet50-v2-7.onnx", module="onnx")
    onnx_model = onnx.load(model_path)







Downloading, Preprocessing, and Loading the Test Image
------------------------------------------------------

Each model is particular when it comes to expected tensor shapes, formats and
data types. For this reason, most models require some pre and
post-processing, to ensure the input is valid and to interpret the output.
TVMC has adopted NumPy's ``.npz`` format for both input and output data.

As input for this tutorial, we will use the image of a cat, but you can feel
free to substitute this image for any of your choosing.

.. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/inputs/kitten.jpg
   :height: 224px
   :width: 224px
   :align: center

Download the image data, then convert it to a numpy array to use as an input to the model.


.. code-block:: default


    img_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/inputs/kitten.jpg"
    img_path = download_testdata(img_url, "imagenet_cat.png", module="data")

    # Resize it to 224x224
    resized_image = Image.open(img_path).resize((224, 224))
    img_data = np.asarray(resized_image).astype("float32")

    # Our input image is in HWC layout while ONNX expects CHW input, so convert the array
    img_data = np.transpose(img_data, (2, 0, 1))

    # Normalize according to the ImageNet input specification
    imagenet_mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).reshape((3, 1, 1))
    imagenet_stddev = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).reshape((3, 1, 1))
    norm_img_data = (img_data / 255 - imagenet_mean) / imagenet_stddev

    # Add the batch dimension, as we are expecting 4-dimensional input: NCHW.
    img_data = np.expand_dims(norm_img_data, axis=0)







Compile the Model With Relay
----------------------------

The next step is to compile the ResNet model. We begin by importing the model
to relay using the `from_onnx` importer. We then build the model, with
standard optimizations, into a TVM library.  Finally, we create a TVM graph
runtime module from the library.


.. code-block:: default


    target = "llvm"







.. note:: Defining the Correct Target

  Specifying the correct target can have a huge impact on the performance of
  the compiled module, as it can take advantage of hardware features
  available on the target. For more information, please refer to
  :ref:`Auto-tuning a convolutional network for x86 CPU <tune_relay_x86>`.
  We recommend identifying which CPU you are running, along with optional
  features, and set the target appropriately. For example, for some
  processors ``target = "llvm -mcpu=skylake"``, or ``target = "llvm
  -mcpu=skylake-avx512"`` for processors with the AVX-512 vector instruction
  set.



.. code-block:: default


    # The input name may vary across model types. You can use a tool
    # like netron to check input names
    input_name = "data"
    shape_dict = {input_name: img_data.shape}

    mod, params = relay.frontend.from_onnx(onnx_model, shape_dict)

    with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
        lib = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)

    dev = tvm.device(str(target), 0)
    module = graph_executor.GraphModule(lib["default"](dev))







Execute on the TVM Runtime
--------------------------
Now that we've compiled the model, we can use the TVM runtime to make
predictions with it. To use TVM to run the model and make predictions, we
need two things:

- The compiled model, which we just produced.
- Valid input to the model to make predictions on.


.. code-block:: default


    dtype = "float32"
    module.set_input(input_name, img_data)
    module.run()
    output_shape = (1, 1000)
    tvm_output = module.get_output(0, tvm.nd.empty(output_shape)).numpy()







Collect Basic Performance Data
------------------------------
We want to collect some basic performance data associated with this
unoptimized model and compare it to a tuned model later. To help account for
CPU noise, we run the computation in multiple batches in multiple
repetitions, then gather some basis statistics on the mean, median, and
standard deviation.


.. code-block:: default

    import timeit

    timing_number = 10
    timing_repeat = 10
    unoptimized = (
        np.array(timeit.Timer(lambda: module.run()).repeat(repeat=timing_repeat, number=timing_number))
        * 1000
        / timing_number
    )
    unoptimized = {
        "mean": np.mean(unoptimized),
        "median": np.median(unoptimized),
        "std": np.std(unoptimized),
    }

    print(unoptimized)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    {'mean': 249.92160882335156, 'median': 249.40169705078006, 'std': 1.3641753266557834}



Postprocess the output
----------------------

As previously mentioned, each model will have its own particular way of
providing output tensors.

In our case, we need to run some post-processing to render the outputs from
ResNet-50-V2 into a more human-readable form, using the lookup-table provided
for the model.


.. code-block:: default


    from scipy.special import softmax

    # Download a list of labels
    labels_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/onnx-model-zoo/synset.txt"
    labels_path = download_testdata(labels_url, "synset.txt", module="data")

    with open(labels_path, "r") as f:
        labels = [l.rstrip() for l in f]

    # Open the output and read the output tensor
    scores = softmax(tvm_output)
    scores = np.squeeze(scores)
    ranks = np.argsort(scores)[::-1]
    for rank in ranks[0:5]:
        print("class='%s' with probability=%f" % (labels[rank], scores[rank]))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    class='n02123045 tabby, tabby cat' with probability=0.610551
    class='n02123159 tiger cat' with probability=0.367180
    class='n02124075 Egyptian cat' with probability=0.019365
    class='n02129604 tiger, Panthera tigris' with probability=0.001273
    class='n04040759 radiator' with probability=0.000261



This should produce the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    # class='n02123045 tabby, tabby cat' with probability=0.610553
    # class='n02123159 tiger cat' with probability=0.367179
    # class='n02124075 Egyptian cat' with probability=0.019365
    # class='n02129604 tiger, Panthera tigris' with probability=0.001273
    # class='n04040759 radiator' with probability=0.000261

Tune the model
--------------
The previous model was compiled to work on the TVM runtime, but did not
include any platform specific optimization. In this section, we will show you
how to build an optimized model using TVM to target your working platform.

In some cases, we might not get the expected performance when running
inferences using our compiled module. In cases like this, we can make use of
the auto-tuner, to find a better configuration for our model and get a boost
in performance. Tuning in TVM refers to the process by which a model is
optimized to run faster on a given target. This differs from training or
fine-tuning in that it does not affect the accuracy of the model, but only
the runtime performance. As part of the tuning process, TVM will try running
many different operator implementation variants to see which perform best.
The results of these runs are stored in a tuning records file.

In the simplest form, tuning requires you to provide three things:

- the target specification of the device you intend to run this model on
- the path to an output file in which the tuning records will be stored
- a path to the model to be tuned.



.. code-block:: default


    import tvm.auto_scheduler as auto_scheduler
    from tvm.autotvm.tuner import XGBTuner
    from tvm import autotvm







Set up some basic parameters for the runner. The runner takes compiled code
that is generated with a specific set of parameters and measures the
performance of it. ``number`` specifies the number of different
configurations that we will test, while ``repeat`` specifies how many
measurements we will take of each configuration. ``min_repeat_ms`` is a value
that specifies how long need to run configuration test. If the number of
repeats falls under this time, it will be increased. This option is necessary
for accurate tuning on GPUs, and is not required for CPU tuning. Setting this
value to 0 disables it. The ``timeout`` places an upper limit on how long to
run training code for each tested configuration.


.. code-block:: default


    number = 10
    repeat = 1
    min_repeat_ms = 0  # since we're tuning on a CPU, can be set to 0
    timeout = 10  # in seconds

    # create a TVM runner
    runner = autotvm.LocalRunner(
        number=number,
        repeat=repeat,
        timeout=timeout,
        min_repeat_ms=min_repeat_ms,
        enable_cpu_cache_flush=True,
    )







Create a simple structure for holding tuning options. We use an XGBoost
algorithim for guiding the search. For a production job, you will want to set
the number of trials to be larger than the value of 10 used here. For CPU we
recommend 1500, for GPU 3000-4000. The number of trials required can depend
on the particular model and processor, so it's worth spending some time
evaluating performance across a range of values to find the best balance
between tuning time and model optimization. Because running tuning is time
intensive we set number of trials to 10, but do not recommend a value this
small. The ``early_stopping`` parameter is the minimum number of trails to
run before a condition that stops the search early can be applied. The
measure option indicates where trial code will be built, and where it will be
run. In this case, we're using the ``LocalRunner`` we just created and a
``LocalBuilder``. The ``tuning_records`` option specifies a file to write
the tuning data to.


.. code-block:: default


    tuning_option = {
        "tuner": "xgb",
        "trials": 10,
        "early_stopping": 100,
        "measure_option": autotvm.measure_option(
            builder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(build_func="default"), runner=runner
        ),
        "tuning_records": "resnet-50-v2-autotuning.json",
    }







.. note:: Defining the Tuning Search Algorithm

  By default this search is guided using an `XGBoost Grid` algorithm.
  Depending on your model complexity and amount of time available, you might
  want to choose a different algorithm.

.. note:: Setting Tuning Parameters

  In this example, in the interest of time, we set the number of trials and
  early stopping to 10. You will likely see more performance improvements if
  you set these values to be higher but this comes at the expense of time
  spent tuning. The number of trials required for convergence will vary
  depending on the specifics of the model and the target platform.


.. code-block:: default


    # begin by extracting the taks from the onnx model
    tasks = autotvm.task.extract_from_program(mod["main"], target=target, params=params)

    # Tune the extracted tasks sequentially.
    for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
        prefix = "[Task %2d/%2d] " % (i + 1, len(tasks))
        tuner_obj = XGBTuner(task, loss_type="rank")
        tuner_obj.tune(
            n_trial=min(tuning_option["trials"], len(task.config_space)),
            early_stopping=tuning_option["early_stopping"],
            measure_option=tuning_option["measure_option"],
            callbacks=[
                autotvm.callback.progress_bar(tuning_option["trials"], prefix=prefix),
                autotvm.callback.log_to_file(tuning_option["tuning_records"]),
            ],
        )

Compiling an Optimized Model with Tuning Data
----------------------------------------------

As an output of the tuning process above, we obtained the tuning records
stored in ``resnet-50-v2-autotuning.json``. The compiler will use the results to
generate high performance code for the model on your specified target.

Now that tuning data for the model has been collected, we can re-compile the
model using optimized operators to speed up our computations.


.. code-block:: default


    with autotvm.apply_history_best(tuning_option["tuning_records"]):
        with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3, config={}):
            lib = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)

    dev = tvm.device(str(target), 0)
    module = graph_executor.GraphModule(lib["default"](dev))







Verify that the optimized model runs and produces the same results:


.. code-block:: default


    dtype = "float32"
    module.set_input(input_name, img_data)
    module.run()
    output_shape = (1, 1000)
    tvm_output = module.get_output(0, tvm.nd.empty(output_shape)).numpy()

    scores = softmax(tvm_output)
    scores = np.squeeze(scores)
    ranks = np.argsort(scores)[::-1]
    for rank in ranks[0:5]:
        print("class='%s' with probability=%f" % (labels[rank], scores[rank]))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    class='n02123045 tabby, tabby cat' with probability=0.610552
    class='n02123159 tiger cat' with probability=0.367179
    class='n02124075 Egyptian cat' with probability=0.019365
    class='n02129604 tiger, Panthera tigris' with probability=0.001273
    class='n04040759 radiator' with probability=0.000261



Verifying that the predictions are the same:

.. code-block:: bash

  # class='n02123045 tabby, tabby cat' with probability=0.610550
  # class='n02123159 tiger cat' with probability=0.367181
  # class='n02124075 Egyptian cat' with probability=0.019365
  # class='n02129604 tiger, Panthera tigris' with probability=0.001273
  # class='n04040759 radiator' with probability=0.000261

Comparing the Tuned and Untuned Models
--------------------------------------
We want to collect some basic performance data associated with this optimized
model to compare it to the unoptimized model. Depending on your underlying
hardware, number of iterations, and other factors, you should see a performance
improvement in comparing the optimized model to the unoptimized model.


.. code-block:: default


    import timeit

    timing_number = 10
    timing_repeat = 10
    optimized = (
        np.array(timeit.Timer(lambda: module.run()).repeat(repeat=timing_repeat, number=timing_number))
        * 1000
        / timing_number
    )
    optimized = {"mean": np.mean(optimized), "median": np.median(optimized), "std": np.std(optimized)}


    print("optimized: %s" % (optimized))
    print("unoptimized: %s" % (unoptimized))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    optimized: {'mean': 208.14901499077678, 'median': 207.8273080289364, 'std': 1.5755151130274634}
    unoptimized: {'mean': 249.92160882335156, 'median': 249.40169705078006, 'std': 1.3641753266557834}



Final Remarks
-------------

In this tutorial, we gave a short example of how to use the TVM Python API
to compile, run, and tune a model. We also discussed the need for pre and
post-processing of inputs and outputs. After the tuning process, we
demonstrated how to compare the performance of the unoptimized and optimize
models.

Here we presented a simple example using ResNet 50 V2 locally. However, TVM
supports many more features including cross-compilation, remote execution and
profiling/benchmarking.
