It is useful when\nthe remote device resource are limited, like Raspberry Pi and mobile\nplatforms. In this tutorial, we will use the Raspberry Pi for a CPU example\nand the Firefly-RK3399 for an OpenCL example.\n"

We only need to build the TVM runtime on\nthe remote device.\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/apache/tvm tvm\ncd tvm\nmake runtime -j2\n```\nAfter building the runtime successfully, we need to set environment variables\nin :code:`~/.bashrc` file. We can edit :code:`~/.bashrc`\nusing :code:`vi ~/.bashrc` and add the line below (Assuming your TVM\ndirectory is in :code:`~/tvm`):\n\n```bash\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/tvm/python\n```\nTo update the environment variables, execute :code:`source ~/.bashrc`.\n\n"

The target triple which might be\n  different for different devices. For example, it is\n  :code:`'llvm -mtriple=armv7l-linux-gnueabihf'` for Raspberry Pi 3B and\n  :code:`'llvm -mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu'` for RK3399.\n\n  Usually, you can query the target by running :code:`gcc -v` on your\n  device, and looking for the line starting with :code:`Target:`\n  (Though it may still be a loose configuration.)\n\n  Besides :code:`-mtriple`, you can also set other compilation options\n  like:\n\n  * -mcpu=<cpuname>\n      Specify a specific chip in the current architecture to generate code for. By default this is inferred from the target triple and autodetected to the current architecture.\n  * -mattr=a1,+a2,-a3,...\n      Override or control specific attributes of the target, such as whether SIMD operations are enabled or not. The default set of attributes is set by the current CPU.\n      To get the list of available attributes, you can do:\n\n```bash\nllc -mtriple=<your device target triple> -mattr=help\n```\n  These options are consistent with [llc](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html).\n  It is recommended to set target triple and feature set to contain specific\n  feature available, so we can take full advantage of the features of the\n  board.\n  You can find more details about cross compilation attributes from\n  [LLVM guide of cross compilation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html).</p></div>\n\n"
