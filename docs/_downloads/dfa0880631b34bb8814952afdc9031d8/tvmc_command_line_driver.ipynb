        "\nGetting Started with TVM command line driver - TVMC\n===================================================\n**Authors**:\n`Leandro Nunes <https://github.com/leandron>`_,\n`Matthew Barrett <https://github.com/mbaret>`_\n\nThis tutorial is an introduction to working with TVMC, the TVM command\nline driver. TVMC is a tool that exposes TVM features such as\nauto-tuning, compiling, profiling and execution of models, via a\ncommand line interface.\n\nIn this tutorial we are going to use TVMC to compile, run and tune a\nResNet-50 on a x86 CPU.\n\nWe are going to start by downloading ResNet 50 V2. Then, we are going\nto use TVMC to compile this model into a TVM module, and use the\ncompiled module to generate predictions. Finally, we are going to experiment\nwith the auto-tuning options, that can be used to help the compiler to\nimprove network performance.\n\nThe final goal is to give an overview of TVMC's capabilities and also\nsome guidance on where to look for more information.\n\n"

        "Using TVMC\n----------\n\nTVMC is a Python application, part of the TVM Python package.\nWhen you install TVM using a Python package, you will get TVMC as\nas a command line application called ``tvmc``.\n\nAlternatively, if you have TVM as a Python module on your\n``$PYTHONPATH``,you can access the command line driver functionality\nvia the executable python module, ``python -m tvm.driver.tvmc``.\n\nFor simplicity, this tutorial will mention TVMC command line using\n``tvmc <options>``, but the same results can be obtained with\n``python -m tvm.driver.tvmc <options>``.\n\nYou can check the help page using:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  tvmc --help\n\n\nAs you can see in the help page, the main features are\naccessible via the subcommands ``tune``, ``compile`` and ``run``.\nTo read about specific options under a given subcommand, use\n``tvmc <subcommand> --help``.\n\nIn the following sections we will use TVMC to tune, compile and\nrun a model. But first, we need a model.\n\n\n"

        "Tuning the model\n----------------\n\nIn some cases, we might not get the expected performance when running\ninferences using our compiled module. In cases like this, we can make use\nof the auto-tuner, to find a better configuration for our model and\nget a boost in performance.\n\nTuning in TVM refers to the process by which a model is optimized\nto run faster on a given target. This differs from training or\nfine-tuning in that it does not affect the accuracy of the model,\nbut only the runtime performance.\n\nAs part of the tuning process, TVM will try running many different\noperator implementation variants to see which perform best. The\nresults of these runs are stored in a tuning records file, which is\nultimately the output of the ``tune`` subcommand.\n\nIn the simplest form, tuning requires you to provide three things:\n\n- the target specification of the device you intend to run this model on;\n- the path to an output file in which the tuning records will be stored, and finally,\n- a path to the model to be tuned.\n\n\nThe example below demonstrates how that works in practice:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  tvmc tune \\\n    --target \"llvm\" \\\n    --output autotuner_records.json \\\n    resnet50-v2-7.onnx\n\n\nTuning sessions can take a long time, so ``tvmc tune`` offers many options to\ncustomize your tuning process, in terms of number of repetitions (``--repeat`` and\n``--number``, for example), the tuning algorithm to be use, and so on.\nCheck ``tvmc tune --help`` for more information.\n\nAs an output of the tuning process above, we obtained the tuning records stored\nin ``autotuner_records.json``. This file can be used in two ways:\n\n- as an input to further tuning (via ``tvmc tune --tuning-records``), or\n- as an input to the compiler\n\nThe compiler will use the results to generate high performance code for the model\non your specified target. To do that we can use ``tvmc compile --tuning-records``.\nCheck ``tvmc compile --help`` for more information.\n\n\n"
