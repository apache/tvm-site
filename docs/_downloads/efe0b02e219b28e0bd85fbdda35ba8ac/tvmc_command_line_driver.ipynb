        "## Using TVMC\n\nTVMC is a Python application, part of the TVM Python package.\nWhen you install TVM using a Python package, you will get TVMC as\nas a command line application called ``tvmc``. The location of this command\nwill vary depending on your platform and installation method.\n\nAlternatively, if you have TVM as a Python module on your\n``$PYTHONPATH``,you can access the command line driver functionality\nvia the executable python module, ``python -m tvm.driver.tvmc``.\n\nFor simplicity, this tutorial will mention TVMC command line using\n``tvmc <options>``, but the same results can be obtained with\n``python -m tvm.driver.tvmc <options>``.\n\nYou can check the help page using:\n\n```bash\ntvmc --help\n```\nThe main features of TVM available to ``tvmc`` are from subcommands\n``compile``, and ``run``, and ``tune``.  To read about specific options under\na given subcommand, use ``tvmc <subcommand> --help``. We will cover each of\nthese commands in this tutorial, but first we need to download a pre-trained\nmodel to work with.\n\n\n"

To use TVMC to run the model and\nmake predictions, we need two things:\n\n- The compiled module, which we just produced.\n- Valid input to the model to make predictions on.\n\nEach model is particular when it comes to expected tensor shapes, formats and\ndata types.

        "## Automatically Tuning the ResNet Model\n\nThe previous model was compiled to work on the TVM runtime, but did not\ninclude any platform specific optimization. In this section, we will show you\nhow to build an optimized model using TVMC to target your working platform.\n\nIn some cases, we might not get the expected performance when running\ninferences using our compiled module.  In cases like this, we can make use of\nthe auto-tuner, to find a better configuration for our model and get a boost\nin performance. Tuning in TVM refers to the process by which a model is\noptimized to run faster on a given target. This differs from training or\nfine-tuning in that it does not affect the accuracy of the model, but only\nthe runtime performance. As part of the tuning process, TVM will try running\nmany different operator implementation variants to see which perform best.\nThe results of these runs are stored in a tuning records file, which is\nultimately the output of the ``tune`` subcommand.\n\nIn the simplest form, tuning requires you to provide three things:\n\n- the target specification of the device you intend to run this model on\n- the path to an output file in which the tuning records will be stored, and\n  finally\n- a path to the model to be tuned.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how that works in practice:\n\n```bash\n# The default search algorithm requires xgboost, see below for further\n# details on tuning search algorithms\npip install xgboost\n\ntvmc tune \\\n--target \"llvm\" \\\n--output resnet50-v2-7-autotuner_records.json \\\nresnet50-v2-7.onnx\n```\nIn this example, you will see better results if you indicate a more specific\ntarget for the ``--target`` flag.  For example, on an Intel i7 processor you\ncould use ``--target llvm -mcpu=skylake``. For this tuning example, we are\ntuning locally on the CPU using LLVM as the compiler for the specified\nachitecture.\n\nTVMC will perform a search against the parameter space for the model, trying\nout different configurations for operators and choosing the one that runs\nfastest on your platform. Although this is a guided search based on the CPU\nand model operations, it can still take several hours to complete the search.\nThe output of this search will be saved to the\n``resnet50-v2-7-autotuner_records.json`` file, which will later be used to\ncompile an optimized model.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Defining the Tuning Search Algorithm</h4><p>By default this search is guided using an ``XGBoost Grid`` algorithm.\nDepending on your model complexity and amount of time avilable, you might\nwant to choose a different algorithm. A full list is available by\nconsulting ``tvmc tune --help``.</p></div>The output will look something like this for a consumer-level Skylake CPU:\n\n```bash\ntvmc tune \\\n--target \"llvm -mcpu=broadwell\" \\\n--output resnet50-v2-7-autotuner_records.json \\\nresnet50-v2-7.onnx\n# [Task  1/24]  Current/Best:    9.65/  23.16 GFLOPS | Progress: (60/1000) | 130.74 s Done.\n# [Task  1/24]  Current/Best:    3.56/  23.16 GFLOPS | Progress: (192/1000) | 381.32 s Done.\n# [Task  2/24]  Current/Best:   13.13/  58.61 GFLOPS | Progress: (960/1000) | 1190.59 s Done.\n# [Task  3/24]  Current/Best:   31.93/  59.52 GFLOPS | Progress: (800/1000) | 727.85 s Done.\n# [Task  4/24]  Current/Best:   16.42/  57.80 GFLOPS | Progress: (960/1000) | 559.74 s Done.\n# [Task  5/24]  Current/Best:   12.42/  57.92 GFLOPS | Progress: (800/1000) | 766.63 s Done.\n# [Task  6/24]  Current/Best:   20.66/  59.25 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 673.61 s Done.\n# [Task  7/24]  Current/Best:   15.48/  59.60 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 953.04 s Done.\n# [Task  8/24]  Current/Best:   31.97/  59.33 GFLOPS | Progress: (972/1000) | 559.57 s Done.\n# [Task  9/24]  Current/Best:   34.14/  60.09 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 479.32 s Done.\n# [Task 10/24]  Current/Best:   12.53/  58.97 GFLOPS | Progress: (972/1000) | 642.34 s Done.\n# [Task 11/24]  Current/Best:   30.94/  58.47 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 648.26 s Done.\n# [Task 12/24]  Current/Best:   23.66/  58.63 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 851.59 s Done.\n# [Task 13/24]  Current/Best:   25.44/  59.76 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 534.58 s Done.\n# [Task 14/24]  Current/Best:   26.83/  58.51 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 491.67 s Done.\n# [Task 15/24]  Current/Best:   33.64/  58.55 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 529.85 s Done.\n# [Task 16/24]  Current/Best:   14.93/  57.94 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 645.55 s Done.\n# [Task 17/24]  Current/Best:   28.70/  58.19 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 756.88 s Done.\n# [Task 18/24]  Current/Best:   19.01/  60.43 GFLOPS | Progress: (980/1000) | 514.69 s Done.\n# [Task 19/24]  Current/Best:   14.61/  57.30 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 614.44 s Done.\n# [Task 20/24]  Current/Best:   10.47/  57.68 GFLOPS | Progress: (980/1000) | 479.80 s Done.\n# [Task 21/24]  Current/Best:   34.37/  58.28 GFLOPS | Progress: (308/1000) | 225.37 s Done.\n# [Task 22/24]  Current/Best:   15.75/  57.71 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 1024.05 s Done.\n# [Task 23/24]  Current/Best:   23.23/  58.92 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 999.34 s Done.\n# [Task 24/24]  Current/Best:   17.27/  55.25 GFLOPS | Progress: (1000/1000) | 1428.74 s Done.\n```\nTuning sessions can take a long time, so ``tvmc tune`` offers many options to customize your tuning\nprocess, in terms of number of repetitions (``--repeat`` and ``--number``, for example), the tuning\nalgorithm to be used, and so on.
