        "\n\n# How to Use TVM Pass Infra\n**Author**: [Zhi Chen](https://github.com/zhiics)\n\nAs the number of optimization passes increases in Relay/tir, it becomes intractable to\nexecute them and maintain their dependencies manually. Therefore, we have\nintroduced an infrastructure to manage the optimization passes and make it\napplicable to different layers of the IR in the TVM stack.\n\nThe optimizations of a Relay/tir program could be applied at various granularity,\nnamely function-level and module-level using :py:class:`tvm.relay.transform.FunctionPass`/\n:py:class:`tvm.tir.transform.PrimFuncPass` and :py:class:`tvm.transform.ModulePass`\nrespectively. Or users can rely on :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` to apply a sequence of passes\non a Relay/tir program where the dependencies between passes can be resolved by the\npass infra. For more details about each type of these passes, please refer to\nthe `pass-infra`\n\nThis tutorial mainly demonstrates how developers can use the pass infra to perform\na certain optimization and create an optimization pipeline for a Relay program.\nThe same approach can be used for tir as well.\n"

        "### Use Sequential to Apply a Sequence of Passes\nApplying passes as above is actually tedious and it may require users to have\nbetter understanding about the dependencies between them. For example, fusion\ncurrently doesn't work well on let bindings. Therefore, we would not be able\nto fuse operators that were fusable if :py:func:`relay.transform.ToANormalForm` is applied before\nfusion, as this pass generates let bindings for each expression to\ncanonicalize a Relay program.\n\nRelay, hence, provides :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` to alleviate developers from handling\nthese issues explicitly by specifying the required passes of each pass and\npacking them as a whole to execute. For example, the same passes can now be\napplied using the sequential style as the following. :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` is\nsimilar to [torch.nn.sequential](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Sequential)\nand [mxnet.gluon.block](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/_modules/mxnet/gluon/block.html).\nFor example, `torch.nn.sequential` is used to contain a sequence of PyTorch\n`Modules` that will be added to build a network.
