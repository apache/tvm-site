It takes in pre-trained\nmachine learning models, compiles and generates deployable modules that can be embedded\nand run everywhere.\nApache TVM also enables customizing optimization processes to introduce new optimizations,\nlibraries, codegen and more.\n\nApache TVM can help to:\n\n- **Optimize** performance of ML workloads, composing libraries and codegen.\n- **Deploy** ML workloads to a diverse set of new environments, including new runtime and new\n  hardware.\n- **Continuously improve and customize** ML deployment pipeline in Python by quickly customizing\n  library dispatching, bringing in customized operators and code generation.\n\n"
