        "\n# Compiling and Optimizing a Model with the Python Interface (AutoTVM)\n**Author**:\n[Chris Hoge](https://github.com/hogepodge)\n\nIn the [TVMC Tutorial](tvmc_command_line_driver), we covered how to compile, run, and tune a\npre-trained vision model, ResNet-50 v2 using the command line interface for\nTVM, TVMC. TVM is more that just a command-line tool though, it is an\noptimizing framework with APIs available for a number of different languages\nthat gives you tremendous flexibility in working with machine learning models.\n\nIn this tutorial we will cover the same ground we did with TVMC, but show how\nit is done with the Python API. Upon completion of this section, we will have\nused the Python API for TVM to accomplish the following tasks:\n\n* Compile a pre-trained ResNet-50 v2 model for the TVM runtime.\n* Run a real image through the compiled model, and interpret the output and model\n  performance.\n* Tune the model that model on a CPU using TVM.\n* Re-compile an optimized model using the tuning data collected by TVM.\n* Run the image through the optimized model, and compare the output and model\n  performance.\n\nThe goal of this section is to give you an overview of TVM's capabilites and\nhow to use them through the Python API.\n"

ResNet-50 is a\nconvolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep and designed to classify\nimages. The model we will be using has been pre-trained on more than a\nmillion images with 1000 different classifications. The network has an input\nimage size of 224x224. If you are interested exploring more of how the\nResNet-50 model is structured, we recommend downloading\n[Netron](https://netron.app), a freely available ML model viewer.\n\nTVM provides a helper library to download pre-trained models. By providing a\nmodel URL, file name, and model type through the module, TVM will download\nthe model and save it to disk. For the instance of an ONNX model, you can\nthen load it into memory using the ONNX runtime.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Working with Other Model Formats</h4><p>TVM supports many popular model formats.

In this section, we will show you\nhow to build an optimized model using TVM to target your working platform.\n\nIn some cases, we might not get the expected performance when running\ninferences using our compiled module. In cases like this, we can make use of\nthe auto-tuner, to find a better configuration for our model and get a boost\nin performance. Tuning in TVM refers to the process by which a model is\noptimized to run faster on a given target. This differs from training or\nfine-tuning in that it does not affect the accuracy of the model, but only\nthe runtime performance. As part of the tuning process, TVM will try running\nmany different operator implementation variants to see which perform best.\nThe results of these runs are stored in a tuning records file.\n\nIn the simplest form, tuning requires you to provide three things:\n\n- the target specification of the device you intend to run this model on\n- the path to an output file in which the tuning records will be stored\n- a path to the model to be tuned.\n\n\n"

We also discussed the need for pre and\npost-processing of inputs and outputs. After the tuning process, we\ndemonstrated how to compare the performance of the unoptimized and optimize\nmodels.\n\nHere we presented a simple example using ResNet-50 v2 locally. However, TVM\nsupports many more features including cross-compilation, remote execution and\nprofiling/benchmarking.\n\n"
