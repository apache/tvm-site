        "\nCompiling and Optimizing a Model with the Python Interface (AutoTVM)\n====================================================================\n**Author**:\n`Chris Hoge <https://github.com/hogepodge>`_\n\nIn the `TVMC Tutorial <tvmc_command_line_driver>`_, we covered how to compile, run, and tune a\npre-trained vision model, ResNet-50 v2 using the command line interface for\nTVM, TVMC. TVM is more that just a command-line tool though, it is an\noptimizing framework with APIs available for a number of different languages\nthat gives you tremendous flexibility in working with machine learning models.\n\nIn this tutorial we will cover the same ground we did with TVMC, but show how\nit is done with the Python API. Upon completion of this section, we will have\nused the Python API for TVM to accomplish the following tasks:\n\n* Compile a pre-trained ResNet-50 v2 model for the TVM runtime.\n* Run a real image through the compiled model, and interpret the output and model\n  performance.\n* Tune the model that model on a CPU using TVM.\n* Re-compile an optimized model using the tuning data collected by TVM.\n* Run the image through the optimized model, and compare the output and model\n  performance.\n\nThe goal of this section is to give you an overview of TVM's capabilites and\nhow to use them through the Python API.\n\n"

        "Downloading and Loading the ONNX Model\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor this tutorial, we will be working with ResNet-50 v2. ResNet-50 is a\nconvolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep and designed to classify\nimages. The model we will be using has been pre-trained on more than a\nmillion images with 1000 different classifications. The network has an input\nimage size of 224x224. If you are interested exploring more of how the\nResNet-50 model is structured, we recommend downloading\n`Netron <https://netron.app>`_, a freely available ML model viewer.\n\nTVM provides a helper library to download pre-trained models. By providing a\nmodel URL, file name, and model type through the module, TVM will download\nthe model and save it to disk. For the instance of an ONNX model, you can\nthen load it into memory using the ONNX runtime.\n\n.. admonition:: Working with Other Model Formats\n\n  TVM supports many popular model formats. A list can be found in the\n  `Compile Deep Learning Models <tutorial-frontend>` section of the TVM\n  Documentation.\n\n"

We also discussed the need for pre and\npost-processing of inputs and outputs. After the tuning process, we\ndemonstrated how to compare the performance of the unoptimized and optimize\nmodels.\n\nHere we presented a simple example using ResNet-50 v2 locally. However, TVM\nsupports many more features including cross-compilation, remote execution and\nprofiling/benchmarking.\n\n"
