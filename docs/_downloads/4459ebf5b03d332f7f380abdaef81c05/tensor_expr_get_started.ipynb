        "\n\nWorking with Operators Using Tensor Expression\n==============================================\n**Author**: `Tianqi Chen <https://tqchen.github.io>`_\n\nIn this tutorial we will turn our attention to how TVM works with Tensor\nExpression (TE) to define tensor computations and apply loop optimizations. TE\ndescribes tensor computations in a pure functional language (that is each\nexpression has no side effects). When viewed in context of the TVM as a whole,\nRelay describes a computation as a set of operators, and each of these\noperators can be represented as a TE expression where each TE expression takes\ninput tensors and produces an output tensor.\n\nThis is an introductory tutorial to the Tensor Expression language in TVM. TVM\nuses a domain specific tensor expression for efficient kernel construction. We\nwill demonstrate the basic workflow with two examples of using the tensor expression\nlanguage. The first example introduces TE and scheduling with vector\naddition. The second expands on these concepts with a step-by-step optimization\nof a matrix multiplication with TE. This matrix multiplication example will\nserve as the comparative basis for future tutorials covering more advanced\nfeatures of TVM.\n\n"

TVM adopts tensor semantics, with\neach intermediate result represented as a multi-dimensional array. The user\nneeds to describe the computation rule that generates the tensors. We first\ndefine a symbolic variable ``n`` to represent the shape. We then define two\nplaceholder Tensors, ``A`` and ``B``, with given shape ``(n,)``. We then\ndescribe the result tensor ``C``, with a ``compute`` operation. The\n``compute`` defines a computation, with the output conforming to the\nspecified tensor shape and the computation to be performed at each position\nin the tensor defined by the lambda function. Note that while ``n`` is a\nvariable, it defines a consistent shape between the ``A``, ``B`` and ``C``\ntensors.

There are\ntwo important optimizations for good CPU performance:**\n\n1. Increase the cache hit rate of memory access.

In this tutorial, we pick a block factor of\n32. This will result in a block that will fill a 32 * 32 * sizeof(float) area\nof memory. This corresponds to a cache size of 4KB, in relation to a\nreference cache size of 32 KB for L1 cache.\n\nWe begin by creating a default schedule for the ``C`` operation, then apply a\n``tile`` scheduling primitive to it with the specified block factor, with the\nscheduling primitive returning the resulting loop order from outermost to\ninnermost, as a vector ``[x_outer, y_outer, x_inner, y_inner]``. We then get\nthe reduction axis for output of the operation, and perform a split operation\non it using a factor of 4. This factor doesn't directly impact the blocking\noptimization we're working on right now, but will be useful later when we\napply vectorization.\n\nNow that the operation has been blocked, we can reorder the computation to\nput the reduction operation into the outermost loop of the computation,\nhelping to guarantee that the blocked data remains in cache.

        "Final Notes and Summary\n-----------------------\nAs mentioned earlier, how to apply optimizations using TE and scheduling\nprimitives can require some knowledge of the underlying architecture and\nalgorithms. However, TE was designed to act as a foundation for more complex\nalgorithms that can search the potential optimization. With the knowledge you\nhave from this introduction to TE, we can now begin to explore how TVM can\nautomate the schedule optimization process.\n\nThis tutorial provided a walkthrough of TVM Tensor Expresstion (TE) workflow\nusing a vector add and a matrix multiplication examples. The general workflow\nis\n\n- Describe your computation via a series of operations.\n- Describe how we want to compute use schedule primitives.\n- Compile to the target function we want.\n- Optionally, save the function to be loaded later.\n\nUpcoming tutorials expand on the matrix multiplication example, and show how\nyou can build generic templates of the matrix multiplication and other\noperations with tunable parameters that allows you to automatically optimize\nthe computation for specific platforms.\n\n"
