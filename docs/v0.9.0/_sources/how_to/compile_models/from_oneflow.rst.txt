Compile OneFlow Models
======================
**Author**: `Xiaoyu Zhang <https://github.com/BBuf/>`_

This article is an introductory tutorial to deploy OneFlow models with Relay.

For us to begin with, OneFlow package should be installed.

A quick solution is to install via pip

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flowvision==0.1.0
    python3 -m pip install -f https://release.oneflow.info oneflow==0.7.0+cpu

or please refer to official site:
https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow

Currently, TVM supports OneFlow 0.7.0. Other versions may be unstable.
